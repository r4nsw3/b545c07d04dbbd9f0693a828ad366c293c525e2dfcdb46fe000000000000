  |   The squid kids called Inklings are back to splat more ink and claim   |
  |   more turf in this colorful and chaotic 4-on-4 action shooter.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go with the          |
  |   Nintendo Switch system, and use any of the console's portable play    |
  |   styles for intense local multiplayer action. Even team up for new     |
  |   4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Two years have passed since the original Splatoon game was            |
  |   released, and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a    |
  |   fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear. Dual      |
  |   wield the new Splat Dualies or stick to mainstays like chargers and   |
  |   rollers, which have been remixed with new strategic possibilities.    |
  |   As always, Turf War is the favored sport among Inklings, but they     |
  |   also dig ranked battles, taking down Octarians in a robust            |
  |   single-player campaign, and battling enemy Salmonids in one           |
  |   dangerous part-time job! No matter which way you play, splat at       |
  |   home or on-the-go with Nintendo Switch. Staying fresh never felt so   |
  |   good.                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Turf War - Team up in fierce 4-on-4 multiplayer battles to see      |
  |     which team can cover the most turf with ink                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Salmon Run - 2-4 players can team up for co-op fun and defeat       |
  |     waves of enemy Salmonids                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * New weapons - Dual wield the new Splat Dualies and avoid getting    |
  |     splatted with the new Dodge Roll move. Mainstays like the Splat     |
  |     Roller and Splat Charger have been remixed to include new           |
  |     gameplay mechanics, and all special weapons are brand-new           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Local and Online Multiplayer - In a first for the series, compete   |
  |     in local multiplayer Turf War battles, whether in TV mode or        |
  |     on-the-go in handheld or tabletop modes. Online battles also make   |
  |     a return                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * New ways to play - Play with the Joy-Con controllers or the         |
  |     Nintendo Switch Pro Controller (sold separately), both of which     |
  |     support motion controls for better aiming                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fresh Updates - Similar to the Splatoon game for the Wii U          |
  |     console, updates will roll out post-launch, adding new content      |
  |     and in-game events                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Smart Device Support - An upcoming smart-device application for     |
  |     the Nintendo Switch system will allow players to set play           |
  |     appointments with friends and teammates, as well as voice chat      |
  |     with friends during play sessions                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * LAN Play - Up to 10 docked systems - eight players and two          |
  |     spectators - can connect via wired LAN (additional accessories      |
  |     required; sold separately). This feature allows players to create   |
  |     local Private Battle tournaments without the need for an internet   |
  |     connection. Local wireless play is perfect for your regular         |
  |     gaming get-togethers, but LAN Play is where it's at when you want   |
  |     to organize a serious tournament                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Customize - Change your Inkling's style with different weapons,     |
  |     headgear, clothes, and shoes. Gear isn't just aesthetic; it         |
  |     offers different boosts in battles                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Amiibo - Compatible with all Splatoon series amiibo figures. By     |
  |     tapping these amiibo, the figure's character will appear in the     |
  |     game and befriend players. Befriend an amiibo character and they    |
  |     will remember favorited weapons, gear, outfits and option           |
  |     settings                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
